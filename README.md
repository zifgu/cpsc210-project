# Course schedule generator

## What is this application?

This application automates the process of organizing your required and elective courses into a schedule. 
As a student myself, I find that the most difficult part of creating a course schedule is putting the courses in order 
so that there are no time conflicts. The user of this application is required to input the courses they are interested 
in taking, and for each course, its status (required vs elective) and all time slots they are considering. The 
application will then calculate and display **all valid schedules** that can be made with the given list of courses. 
Rather than spending hours putting together course lists, students can simply browse the returned options and select 
the ones they prefer.

**Note:** Currently, this application is best applied to courses taken at UBC.
